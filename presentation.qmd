# Chapter 1: <br> The Noisy Work of Uncertainty Visualisation

## A single example
- We are going to work through a single example for this talk
- It makes the ideas we are talking about easier to understand
- I also don't have to do as much work

## A strange emergency I invented for this talk
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/img0.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Reports that average temperatures in Iowa are very odd!
- Stumping climate scientists who are looking at it!!
- Need to understand and communicate this weird temperature issue!!!

:::

::::

## Temperatures in Iowa
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
toy_temp |>
  as_tibble() |>
  select(scientistID, county_name,recorded_temp) |>
  head(10) |>
  gt()|>
  tab_header(title = "Citizen Scientist Temperature Collection",
             subtitle = "Data from Iowa Counties") |>
  cols_label( 
    scientistID = "Scientist ID", 
    county_name = "County Name", 
    recorded_temp = "Recorded Temp")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Maintain privacy because doing science in Iowa is now a crime.

:::

::::


## Calculating Estimates
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
# Mean data
toy_temp_mean <- toy_temp |> 
  group_by(county_name) |>
  summarise(temp_mean = mean(recorded_temp)) 

toy_temp_mean |> 
  as_tibble() |>
  select(county_name, temp_mean) |>
  head(10) |>
  gt()|>
  tab_header(title = "Average Temperature",
             subtitle = "Estimates for Iowa Counties") |>
  cols_label(
    county_name = "County Name", 
    temp_mean = "Mean Temperature")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Can you see the weird temperature trend?
:::

::::


## Choropleth Map
```{r}
p_choro <- ggplot(toy_temp_mean) +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry=county_geometry, fill=temp_mean)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "YlOrRd", direction= 1) +
  xlab("Longitude") +
  ylab("Latitude") +
  labs(fill = "Temperature") +
  ggtitle("Choropleth Map")
p_choro
```

## Why communicate with a visualisation?

- "Ah I see"
- Utilises lizard brain
- Conveys a large amount of information at once


```{r}
#| fig-align: center
p_choro
```

## Fine if we are communicating with...
![](images/img3.jpg)

## Harder if we are communicating with...
![](images/img4.jpeg)

## Oh no, a hurdle

![](images/img5.jpeg)


## Turns out mum is kind of right....
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- We find out some citizen scientists are using some pretty old tools
- The standard error **could** be our estimate....
  - or it could be about three times that.
- Does the spatial trend still exist in the high variance case?
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/img6.jpeg)
:::

::::

## Spot the difference
```{r}
# same plot twice lol
p1 <- p_choro + ggtitle("Low Variance")
p2 <- p_choro + ggtitle("High Variance")
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

## We Need to Include Uncertainty
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
- Failing to include uncertainty can be akin to fraud or lying
  - Transparency increases trust
  - Prevents bad actors from exploiting hidden variance
- Promotes better decisions

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/img7.jpeg)
:::

::::

## We are also communicating with...

![](images/img8.jpeg)


## Uncertainty visualisation should...
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/img9.jpeg)
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}

<br>

1) Reinforce justified signals
  - We want my mum to trust the results


2) Hide signals that are just noise
  - I don’t want to see something that isn’t there

:::

::::


## How do we please my mother??? <br> (and also me)
```{r}
#| include: false
ggplot(toy_temp_mean) +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry=county_geometry), fill="white") +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Longitude") +
  ylab("Latitude") +
  labs(fill = "Temperature")
```

![](images/img2.jpeg)


## Solution: add an axis for uncertainty
![](images/img10.jpeg)

## Does this work? Not really {.smaller}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/img11.jpeg)
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}

- Pro
  - Included uncertainty and increased transparency
- Cons
  - Non-existent signals are still visible so I am still getting scammed
  - People can (and do) ignore the uncertainty
  - 2D palette is harder to read
    - Colour hues are not a simple 2D space
  - Using saturation hurts accessibility

:::
::::

## Why doesn't this work? 
- Uncertainty is not just another variable…
  - We do not have a high-dimension visualisation or basic heuristic problem

- Two dimensions = No interference
  - Normal visualization = GOOD!
  - Uncertainty visualization = BAD! 

## Signal suppression 

![](images/img12.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

- Visualising uncertainty as noise.
- The error (noise) *should* interfere with our reading of the temperature (signal)
- But *only* when the signal has high error


## Solution: blend the colours together!
![](images/img13.jpeg)

## Does this work? Kind of...
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/img15.jpeg)
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
- Pros
  - Included uncertainty
  - Non-existent trend gone! 
  - Uncertainty hard to ignore
- Cons
  - Still have 2D Colour palette 
    - Saturation hurts accessibility
  - Standard error at which to blend colours is made up
    - Impossible to align with hypothesis testing
 
 
:::

::::

## Solution: simulate a sample

![](images/img14.jpeg)

## Does this work? Almost!
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/img16.jpeg)
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
- Pros
  - Included uncertainty
  - Non-existent trend gone! 
  - Uncertainty hard to ignore
  - 1D colour palette 
    - No more weird colour space
    - More accessible

- Cons
  - Nightmare to make

:::

::::

## Chapter 1 Summary
- Plot uncertainty with the purpose of ”signal suppression” in mind
- Not all methods are equal
  - Sample works pretty well
  - VSUP also has some potential if we can work out some perception rules

# Chapter 2: ggdibbler



# Chapter 3: Visualisation Experiment


## ggdibbler use
```{r}
# Plot Distribution Data
ggplot(toy_temp_dist) +
  geom_sf_sample(aes(geometry=county_geometry, fill=temp_dist),  linewidth=0.1) +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = county_geometry), fill=NA, linewidth=1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "YlOrRd", direction= 1) +
  xlab("Longitude") +
  ylab("Latitude") +
  labs(fill = "Temperature")
```

## Potential Limitations

## Conclusion & Future Work
- Different types of plots (e.g. scatter plot)
- Different data types for the uncertainty. Currently only have uncertainty in estimates, but could have uncertainty in location in a map for example.
- Alternative variations, e.g. bivariate map.
  - Could implement these methods across different plot types. e.g. what does the space transformation in the bivariate map look like when the x and y component are both spatial instead of coloured.
- Entirely new approaches
- Want to add dibble object so that it is automatic.
- Should include density objects as a "stat_identity" option for the sake of completeness.

## Other Cases
- Visualisations where values are actually estimates
  - e.g. Statistical summaries
  - e.g. Using data from ABS (or other government organisation)
  
<!--
## Looking at the data
```{r}
ggplot(toy_temp) +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry=county_geometry), fill="white") +
  geom_jitter(aes(x=county_longitude, y=county_latitude, colour=recorded_temp, alpha=0.5), 
              width=5000, height =5000, alpha=0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_distiller(palette = "YlOrRd", direction= 1) +
  xlab("Longitude") +
  ylab("Latitude") +
  labs(colour = "Temperature") 
```

## Estimate as a Mean and Standard Error
```{r}
toy_temp_est <- toy_temp |> 
  group_by(county_name) |>
  summarise(temp_mean = mean(recorded_temp),
            temp_se = sd(recorded_temp)/sqrt(n())) 

toy_temp_est |> 
  as_tibble() |>
  select(county_name, temp_mean, temp_se) |>
  head(10) |>
  gt()|>
  tab_header(title = "Average Citizen Scientist Temperature",
             subtitle = "Estimates for Iowa Counties") |>
  tab_spanner(
    label = "Temperature",
    columns = c(temp_mean, temp_se)) |>
  cols_label(
    county_name = "County Name", 
    temp_mean = "Mean",
    temp_se = "Standard Error")
```
## Estimate as a Distribution
```{r}
# set large variance multiplier
m <- 2
toy_temp_est <- toy_temp |> 
  group_by(county_name) |>
  summarise(temp_mean = mean(recorded_temp),
            temp_se_low = sd(recorded_temp)/sqrt(n()),
            temp_se_high = 2*temp_se_low) 
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
toy_temp_dist <- toy_temp_est |> 
  mutate(temp_dist_low = dist_normal(temp_mean, temp_se_low),
         temp_dist_high = dist_normal(temp_mean, temp_se_high)) |>
  select(county_name, temp_dist_low, temp_dist_high) 

toy_temp_dist |> 
  as_tibble() |>
  select(county_name, temp_dist_low, temp_dist_high) |>
  head(10) |>
  gt() |>
  tab_header(title = "Average Temperature",
             subtitle = "Estimates for Iowa Counties") |>
  cols_label(county_name = "County Name", 
             temp_dist = "Mean Temperature")
```
