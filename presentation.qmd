# Introduction: Communicate a Spatial Trend

## Emergency!
- Reports that temperature in Iowa is weird as hell!
- Very serious!!
- Need to communicate this weird temperature issue to the public!!!

## Fake temperatures in Iowa
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
toy_temp |>
  as_tibble() |>
  select(scientistID, county_name,recorded_temp) |>
  head(10) |>
  gt()|>
  tab_header(title = "Citizen Scientist Temperature Collection",
             subtitle = "Data from Iowa Counties") |>
  cols_label( 
    scientistID = "Scientist ID", 
    county_name = "County Name", 
    recorded_temp = "Recorded Temp")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Maintain privacy because doing science in Iowa is now a crime.

## Calculating Estimates
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
# Mean data
toy_temp_mean <- toy_temp |> 
  group_by(county_name) |>
  summarise(temp_mean = mean(recorded_temp)) 

toy_temp_mean |> 
  as_tibble() |>
  select(county_name, temp_mean) |>
  head(10) |>
  gt()|>
  tab_header(title = "Average Temperature",
             subtitle = "Estimates for Iowa Counties") |>
  cols_label(
    county_name = "County Name", 
    temp_mean = "Mean Temperature")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Can you see the weird temperature trend?

## Choropleth Map
```{r}
p_choro <- ggplot(toy_temp_mean) +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry=county_geometry, fill=temp_mean)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "YlOrRd", direction= 1) +
  xlab("Longitude") +
  ylab("Latitude") +
  labs(fill = "Temperature") +
  ggtitle("Choropleth Map")
p_choro
```

## Why communicate with a visualisation?

- "Ah I see"
- Utilises lizard brain
- Conveys a large amount of information at once


```{r}
#| fig-align: center
p_choro
```

## Fine if we are communicating with...

## Harder if we are communicating with...

## Oh no, a hurdle

## We Need to Include Uncertainty
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
- Failing to include uncertainty can be akin to fraud or lying
  - Transparency increases trust
  - Prevents bad actors from exploiting hidden variance
- Promotes better decisions

::: {.column width="30%"}

## Turns out mum is kind of right....
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- We find out some citizen scientists are using some pretty old tools
- The standard error **could** be our estimate....
  - or it could be at least two times that.
- Does the spatial trend still exist in the high variance case?

## Spot the difference
```{r}
# same plot twice lol
p1 <- p_choro + ggtitle("Low Variance")
p2 <- p_choro + ggtitle("High Variance")
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```


## How do we please my mother???
```{r}
#| include: false
ggplot(toy_temp_mean) +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry=county_geometry), fill="white") +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Longitude") +
  ylab("Latitude") +
  labs(fill = "Temperature")

# Thesis Overview
## Thesis Overview
- Chapter 1: The Noisy Work of Uncertainty Visualisation
  - Literarture review
  - Define problem
  - Identify gaps (for chapter 2 and 3)

- Chapter 2: `ggdibbler` package 
  - `ggplot2` extension

- Chapter 3: Visualisation experiment
  - Based on AEMO case study

## Progress to date
- Chapter 1 was submitted to the journal *Annual Reviews of Statistics and It's Applications* for publication, and is now an invited contribution to Volume 14 of the Journal.
- `ggdibbler` has been submitted to CRAN 
- Currently working on `ggdibbler` paper 




## ggdibbler use
```{r}
# Plot Distribution Data
ggplot(toy_temp_dist) +
  geom_sf_sample(aes(geometry=county_geometry, fill=temp_dist),  linewidth=0.1) +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = county_geometry), fill=NA, linewidth=1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "YlOrRd", direction= 1) +
  xlab("Longitude") +
  ylab("Latitude") +
  labs(fill = "Temperature")
```

## Timeline
|Date|Description|
|:-|:---|
|July 2025|Submit `ggdibbler` to CRAN. Pre-submission milestone. Implement VSUP elements in package. |
|August 2025|Present `ggdibbler` at useR! 2025 and receive feedback. Finish the `ggdibbler` paper and submit to the Journal of Statistical Software. Decide on a case study for the experiment in consultation with an AEMO research representative. |

## Future Work
- Different types of plots (e.g. scatter plot)
- Different data types for the uncertainty. Currently only have uncertainty in estimates, but could have uncertainty in location in a map for example.
- Alternative variations, e.g. bivariate map.
  - Could implement these methods across different plot types. e.g. what does the space transformation in the bivariate map look like when the x and y component are both spatial instead of coloured.
- Entirely new approaches
- Want to add dibble object so that it is automatic.
- Should include density objects as a "stat_identity" option for the sake of completeness.

## Other Cases
- Visualisations where values are actually estimates
  - e.g. Statistical summaries
  - e.g. Using data from ABS (or other government organisation)
  
<!--
## Looking at the data
```{r}
ggplot(toy_temp) +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry=county_geometry), fill="white") +
  geom_jitter(aes(x=county_longitude, y=county_latitude, colour=recorded_temp, alpha=0.5), 
              width=5000, height =5000, alpha=0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_distiller(palette = "YlOrRd", direction= 1) +
  xlab("Longitude") +
  ylab("Latitude") +
  labs(colour = "Temperature") 
```

## Estimate as a Mean and Standard Error
```{r}
toy_temp_est <- toy_temp |> 
  group_by(county_name) |>
  summarise(temp_mean = mean(recorded_temp),
            temp_se = sd(recorded_temp)/sqrt(n())) 

toy_temp_est |> 
  as_tibble() |>
  select(county_name, temp_mean, temp_se) |>
  head(10) |>
  gt()|>
  tab_header(title = "Average Citizen Scientist Temperature",
             subtitle = "Estimates for Iowa Counties") |>
  tab_spanner(
    label = "Temperature",
    columns = c(temp_mean, temp_se)) |>
  cols_label(
    county_name = "County Name", 
    temp_mean = "Mean",
    temp_se = "Standard Error")
```
## Estimate as a Distribution
```{r}
# set large variance multiplier
m <- 2
toy_temp_est <- toy_temp |> 
  group_by(county_name) |>
  summarise(temp_mean = mean(recorded_temp),
            temp_se_low = sd(recorded_temp)/sqrt(n()),
            temp_se_high = 2*temp_se_low) 
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
toy_temp_dist <- toy_temp_est |> 
  mutate(temp_dist_low = dist_normal(temp_mean, temp_se_low),
         temp_dist_high = dist_normal(temp_mean, temp_se_high)) |>
  select(county_name, temp_dist_low, temp_dist_high) 

toy_temp_dist |> 
  as_tibble() |>
  select(county_name, temp_dist_low, temp_dist_high) |>
  head(10) |>
  gt() |>
  tab_header(title = "Average Temperature",
             subtitle = "Estimates for Iowa Counties") |>
  cols_label(county_name = "County Name", 
             temp_dist = "Mean Temperature")
```
